## Executive Summary
The business delivered **$12.5M** in completed-order revenue over the past 12 months, with the top 20 customers alone contributing **$1.57M (12.6%)** and showing strong engagement in premium electronics. Revenue accelerated sharply through the holiday peak, hitting **$1.87M in November** before a modest seasonal dip in December. High-rated products (4–5 stars) generated **92.6%** of revenue, underscoring the commercial impact of product quality. To sustain growth, we should double down on electronics assortment, formalize loyalty programs for emerging whales, and address underperforming categories (Books & Clothing) with refreshed offers and inventory optimization.

## Customer Insights
| Metric | Insight |
| --- | --- |
| **Revenue Concentration** | Top 20 customers (2% of active base) delivered **$1.57M**, representing **12.6%** of total revenue; all favor electronics, signaling concentration risk in a single category. |
| **Purchase Behavior** | Elite customers average **10–16** completed orders with ticket sizes of **$5.1K–$9.5K**, indicating willingness to bundle high-value carts. |
| **Retention Signals** | High-value shoppers remain active for **300–600 days**; cohorts from **Sep–Oct 2024** show purchase rates above **80%** and **3.2 orders/customer**, evidencing healthy re-engagement. |
| **Risk Areas** | New whale acquisitions (e.g., customers with tenure ≤ 125 days) already top the list; without early-life nurturing, churn risk is elevated. Cohorts in **Aug 2023 (62% purchase rate)** and **Jun 2024 (70%)** lag the average, requiring targeted campaigns. |

## Product & Category Insights
| Category | Revenue | Units Sold | Avg Price | Avg Rating | Diagnosis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Electronics** | **$10.6M (85%)** | 7,678 | $1,442 | 4.25 | Flagship growth engine with strong margins and reviews; continue premium assortment & attach bundles. |
| **Home & Garden** | $1.14M | 2,179 | $547 | 4.03 | Mid-tier performer; opportunity to grow via cross-sell to electronics buyers for smart-home packages. |
| **Sports** | $0.47M | 1,182 | $416 | 4.10 | Stable niche; focus on high-margin subcategories (fitness accessories). |
| **Clothing** | $0.23M | 1,669 | $147 | 3.77 | Underperforming: lower ASP and rating drag; prioritize supplier renegotiation and limit slow movers. |
| **Books** | $0.04M | 715 | $60 | 3.92 | Minimal contribution; consider converting inventory to digital partnerships or bundling for loyalty perks. |

**Pricing & Ratings Impact**
- Products with **4–5★ ratings deliver 92.6%** of revenue and average **$96.4K** per product, more than 12x higher than the 3–4★ segment.
- Low-rated items (≤3★) contribute <1% revenue yet consume catalog slots—prime candidates for SKU rationalization or quality fixes.

**Inventory & Merchandising Recommendations**
- Prioritize replenishment of top electronics SKUs ahead of promotional pushes.
- Bundle Home & Garden accessories with electronics to lift AOV and diversify revenue streams.
- Sunset or refresh low-rated clothing/books SKUs; allocate shelf space to better-performing product lines.

| Month | Revenue | MoM Growth | Unique Customers | Notes |

- **Trendline:** Revenues nearly **quadrupled** from February ($0.24M) to November ($1.87M), with order volumes scaling from **43** to **366**.
- **Seasonality:** Strong November–December seasonality suggests we should lock in holiday campaigns early; maintain engagement to reduce January drop-off.
